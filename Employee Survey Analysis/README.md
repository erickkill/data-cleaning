# Exploring Employee Surveys

In this project, we'll work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. You can find the TAFE exit survey here and the survey for the DETE here.

1. Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
2. Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?


## Objectives

1. Identify Missing Values and Drop Unecessary Columns
2. Rename Columns
3. Filter Data
4. Verify the DataÂ¶
5. Identify Dissatisfied Employees
6. Combining the Data
7. Perform Some Initial Analysis

## Results
From the initial analysis, we can tentatively conclude that employees with 7 or more years of service are more likely to resign due to some kind of dissatisfaction with the job than employees with less than 7 years of service. However, we need to handle the rest of the missing data to finalize our analysis.
